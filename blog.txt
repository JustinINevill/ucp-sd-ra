Releasing our first Docker Reference Architecuture


We recently announced Docker Datacenter to help you build an end-to-end Container as a Service (CaaS) platform to deploy your applications quickly, secuely, and efficently. Docker Datacenter includes Universal Control Plane (UCP), Docker Trusted Resgitry(DTR), and Commercially Supported Docker Engine.

We are very keen to helping you design and build production-ready Docker platform that incorporates operational best-practices and industry standard solutions. To help our customers build a CaaS __platform__ (and not just a set of independent components) we will be releasing a series of Docker Reference Architectures(RA).

The first refernce architecture we are releasing is focused on Service Discovery and Load Balancing with Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP).
